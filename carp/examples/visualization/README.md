# CARP Visualization

The scripts provided show how to visualize CARPs latent space. plot_review_umap.py will plot a UMAP reduction of a random sample of embeddings from the Story-Critique dataset with the CARP-L model, the checkpoint for which can be found on [the eye](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/CARP/CARP_L.pt). The checkpoint is expected in folder "checkpoints/CARP_L".
